# CoDiPack contributor license agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CoDiPack.

CoDiPack will always be available under an open-source license. Currently, CoDiPack is available under GPLv3.

A contributor does not lose the rights to the contribution. You still can do whatever you want with your contribution. Also, it will always be available under the license that CoDiPack had when the contribution was submitted.
However, applying for project grants and cooperations with industrial partners may make it necessary for us to relicense CoDiPack under any license.

Consequently, before we can merge your changes, we need you to sign the
[CLA](https://gist.github.com/MaxSagebaum/b9e831cb01da96941acaa0cbae7b09ef) for CoDiPack. The purpose of this contributor agreement
is to clarify and document the rights granted by contributors to us.  Please see below for a general review of the CLA and additional justifications.
You can sign the CLA via the [cla-assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) ([Privacy Policy](https://gist.github.com/CLAassistant/3a73e4cd729c9d0a6e30#file-privacy-md)) in your
pull request or send a signed copy to [codi@scicomp.uni-kl.de](mailto:codi@scicomp.uni-kl.de).

If you are an employee and have created the contribution as part of your employment, you need to have your employer
sign the [entity](https://gist.github.com/MaxSagebaum/ef8dc1a5ed23514783b4c6ec022c7f31) version of the CLA.
